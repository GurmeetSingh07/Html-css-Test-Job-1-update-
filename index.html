          <h1>EXECUTIVE COMMUNICATION COACHING</h1>
          <p>
            Are you in business, politics, or a position of responsibility? Do
            you want to influence those around you in a way that improves your
            reputation?
          </p>
          <p>
            Do you want to be understood and remembered? Would you like to be
            highly respected and for people to act on what you’ve said after
            meeting you in person. Would you like to be able to tell a
            compelling story or give a speech that has your audience hooked?
            Maybe your needs are a little more human and lower key…maybe you’d
            like more confidence, to be more approachable and likeable and to
            influence other people in a way that generates warmth, admiration
            and connection…
          </p>
          <p>
            If so, this is your opportunity to be personally coached by the
            Founder & CEO of the foremost professional skills training company
            in the world.
          </p>
          <p>
            For the last 20 years Nick Smallman, has been showing people all
            over the world how to develop their Charisma, Gravitas and Presence.
            These are the essential attributes of all highly successful people,
            and his executive coaching will give you these skills.
          </p>
          <h3>A different coaching method</h3>
          <p>
            A lot of executive coaching fails because the client is told what to
            do and to replace their current methods and technique.
            Unfortunately, human beings are creatures of habit and insecurity.
            Usually, we all revert to old behaviours, so the new way gets lost.
          </p>
          <h3>Reorganising the mind</h3>
          <p>
            Nick will show you how to become an extraordinary speaker and
            communicator by using a series of psychological techniques that once
            employed and embedded, strengthen your ability over time. Good
            coaching is about changing your mind on a fundamental level rather
            than showing you what to do. Real growth is psychological. The
            physical will follow. He will teach you techniques not by telling
            you what to do but instead by giving you solutions that embed
            themselves in your thinking. Over time, many of the things you
            thought were beyond possibility become easy and natural.
